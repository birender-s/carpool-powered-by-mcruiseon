## Features ##
### Registration ###
Registration will be first step your customers will complete before using your carpool app. Each user will need to provide personal details like name, address, phone, email and driving license details. This helps in ensuring that your database is populated with valid and serious users.
### Add Vehicle ###
Once registered, your customer will associate their owned vehicles they which to provide new carpools with. This is optional if the customer only wishes to search and subscribe to other carpools. Verifiable details like registration number, engine number, chassis number, insurance details help ensure genuineness of the owner. This information may not be passed on to the subscribers until the ride is confirmed. This prevents any private sharing of information, also helps ensure that the owner authorizes who/when the personal details are shared.

If you think about it, you can create a web application for your call center to accept new registrations and vehicle information. Once they are registered, you can provide them with a simple 1 page application to share their rides, or search for rides.
### Add Provider ###
Here you associate a actual ride with a vehicle just added to the profile. This will associate a start gps, end gps, start time, end time and their associated distance and time radius. For obvious reasons the radius plays a very important role, since getting a exact match will be a very low probability (0 probability to get someone who is sitting right next to you).
### Subscriber Search ###
Here you associate your start gps, end gps, start time, end time and their associated distance and time radius. This helps in searching for people in the same locality, area or city. The more flexible you are, the more results return.
